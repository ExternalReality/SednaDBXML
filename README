SednaDBXML is a Haskell library and a binding to
the C language drivers of sedna native XML
Database System.

This software is in an extremely early state. The
low level c bindings are still being established
and work on the higher level abstractions have yet
to begin.

Please keep an eye on this repository and watch
for changes. In the mean time, checkout the sedna
homepage http://www.sedna.org/ and try some of the
other excellent language bindings for sedna.
